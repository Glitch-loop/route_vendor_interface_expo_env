Bug: Start inventory operation unable to modify
01/11/25 10:30 AM
Bug
It was not possible to modify the start shift inventory.

Context
Vendor started the route, he declared the products that was going to take and closed the inventory operation. He noticed he made a mistake, so it was necessary to modify the start shift inventory. 
Vendor was to the menu to modify it and the screen only displayed a menu with a loader (it never showed the inventory to modify it).


Replication
1. Start a new day
2. Go to the card to "view" the start shift inventory
3. Click in "modify button".

Considerations
It was carrying out an alpha testing, vendor created a new work day, but at that moment there were not all the products stored in the system.
Manager noticed this and the missing products were inserted in the database.
So, it is possible that this "modifications" in the database could affect in the process of retrieving the information to perform an inventory operation modification.

Bug: When new products are added and there is a workday going on, those new products are not being added to the vendor's inventory operation
