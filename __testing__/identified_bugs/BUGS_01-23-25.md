### Chronological logic in the route.
**Description**

There is not strictly a bug but if the vendor doesn't follow the route as it was designed, it is hard to recreate the history.
Since the list of stores follow a cardinal number, it turns hard to know what comes first.

_STATUS: SOVLED_

Solution:
The purpouse of the list of 'operations day' is to have a guide of how the vendor should make the route. It is possible to make a store before of the "current store" that it should be and although it is not reflected directly in the list (e.g. the attended store is printed before the current one), in the records are being registered the movement of the operations.

At the end, what actually matters is "when" the operations (route transactions and inventory operations) were made, and not the list that appears in the screen.

So, finishing, in the vendor's screen the list won't be modified if the vendor makes a next store before of the current one, but in the manager's screens it will be shown how the route was actually made (this throught consulting the transactions and inventory operations).
